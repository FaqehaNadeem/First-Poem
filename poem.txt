First poem

Keeping it simple
back to square one

Starting over,
watching Daniel Shiffman's
Git and Github
for poets
playlist

starting with new tools
and a new purpose
for programming

Unlearning and Relearning
beginning 
with version control

Learning to share and collaborate
keeping track
of all the 
old versions

writing some bad poetry,
instead of none at all
