Second Commit

A poem,
starting again—
not from scratch,
but from version two.

Didn’t know where to begin,
so I asked AI,
revisiting
Daniel Shiffman’s
Git and GitHub for Poets.

Relearning
after unlearning,
committing words
to the page,
knowing this isn’t
the best poem—
not yet.

But every repo
needs a second commit.
